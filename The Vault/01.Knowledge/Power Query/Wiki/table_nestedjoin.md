# Table.NestedJoin

Joins the rows of table1 with the rows of table2 based on the equality of the values of the key columns selected by key1 (for table1) and key2 (for table2). The results are entered into the column named newColumnName. The optional joinKind specifies the kind of join to perform. By default, a left outer join is performed if a joinKind is not specified. An optional set of keyEqualityComparers may be included to specify how to compare the key columns. This keyEqualityComparers feature is currently intended for internal use only. Example Join two tables using a single key column. Usage Power Query M Table.NestedJoin( Table.FromRecords({ [CustomerToCall = 1], [CustomerToCall = 3] }), {"CustomerToCall"}, Table.FromRecords({ [CustomerID = 1, Name = "Bob", Phone = "123-4567"], [CustomerID = 2, Name = "Jim", Phone = "987-6543"], [CustomerID = 3, Name = "Paul", Phone = "543-7890"], --- PAGE 1058 --- [CustomerID = 4, Name = "Ringo", Phone = "232-1550"] }), {"CustomerID"}, "CustomerDetails" ) Output Power Query M Table.FromRecords({ [CustomerToCall = 1, CustomerDetails = Table.FromRecords({[CustomerID = 1, Name = "Bob", Phone = "123-4567"]})], [CustomerToCall = 3, CustomerDetails = Table.FromRecords({[CustomerID = 3, Name = "Paul", Phone = "543-7890"]})] }) Related content Join kind Last updated on 03/24/2026 --- PAGE 1059 ---
